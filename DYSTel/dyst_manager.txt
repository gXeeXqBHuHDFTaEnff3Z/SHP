# Mission

The scripts mission is to be a worker that runs and watches over two network script called DYSTel_CR and DYSTel_CS.

## input

- filepath_config (default: config.yaml)

The config.yaml file holds all the parameters used for the CR and CS scripts.

## processing

(1) change the working directory to the directory where this script is located
(2) start rotating log
(3) repeat until stopped:
	(a) start CR script
	(b) wait 3 seconds
	(c) start CS script
	(d) if one of the child scripts is stopped, stop the other one as well
	(e) repeat

Give the output of both child scripts on console with a prefix of "(CS)" or "(CR)". prefix your own with "(MA)". Make sure the child scripts run well in parallel and you are not using up all cpu cores.
